Classification with Kmeans

This code implements the K-Means clustering algorithm in Python using NumPy and data visualization with Matplotlib. The KMeans class allows you to fit the model to a data set, identifying the centroids and assigning each point to the cluster whose centroid is the closest. Below is a guide on how to use and understand the code.
